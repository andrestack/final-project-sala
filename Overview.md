# Capstone Project: Sala
---

## Value Proposition:

Sala is an application intended for teachers, coaches, tutors and all professionals who teach or do online consultations on a regular basis. It is a one-stop-shop for all the relevant resources and processes related to online teaching and coaching. A few button clicks should enable the user to perform certain tasks that would otherwise demand oder browser tabs or software open.

Its main feature (tbc) is the very easy and intuitive invoice generation tool.  

### User Stories:

**Story 1 - Start Meeting**

As a user/freelance teacher
I want to be able to start a meeting and make use of all the functionality of the Jitsi Meet Application
I will want to share a secure (by having a secure meeting name) meeting link with my students.


**Story 2 - Open Jitsi Meet:**

As a user/freelance teacher
I want to be able to click the “Start Meeting” and open my Jitsi Interface,
So that I do not have the meeting prompted straight away and also that I do not need to start the meeting in a different tab/URL

**Acceptance criteria and tasks can be found inside the README.md of each branch / user story**

**to be continued...**
