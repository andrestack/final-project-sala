# Capstone Project: Sala
---

## Value Proposition:

Sala is an application intended for teachers, coaches, tutors and all professionals who teach or do online consultations on a regular basis. It is a one-stop-shop for all the relevant resources and processes related to online teaching and coaching. A few button clicks should enable the user to perform certain tasks that would otherwise demand oder browser tabs or software open.

Its main feature (tbc) is the very easy and intuitive invoice generation tool.  

### User Stories:

**Story 1 - Start Meeting**

As a user/freelance teacher
I want to be able to start a meeting and make use of all the functionality of the Jitsi Meet Application
I will want to share a secure (by having a secure meeting name) meeting link with my students.


**Story 2 - Open Jitsi Meet:**

As a user/freelance teacher
I want to be able to click the “Start Meeting” and open my Jitsi Interface,
So that I do not have the meeting prompted straight away and also that I do not need to start the meeting in a different tab/URL

**Story 3 - Fetch start and meeting time**

As a user/teacher/coach/tutor  

I want to be able to time the lessons duration and have this information shown on a different page, i.e. a lesson overview page. 

This will give me the list of all the lessons taught via the interface including: date, course code, room name, duration, nr of units, my fee per unit and total amount earned.

**Story 4 - invoice generator**

I want to be able to add the course code I am about to teach before I start my meeting.

This course code will be then showing on my lessons overview page.

**Story 6 - Invoice Overview Paget**
